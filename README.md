# My Neovim configuration.

Well, I don't really know how to start talking about this, but, this is my
config.

It has around 30 plugins, all of the are made using lua.

16 of them are just themes, so it's not as bloated as it seems.

I've configured it to be a personal IDE, and one that I could modify easily, as
such, even if you are a noob, it's possible to use and change this config at
will whithout much of a headache.

Some of the things that you will probably need pre-instaled on your computer
are:

- fzf
- tree-sitter
- nerd-fonts
- clang/gcc (these are a must, since the tree-sitter's so's are compiled during
  the first execution)

The package manager used here is
[Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

Here is a screenshot of it:
